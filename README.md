# Envirya Project

Ecore.js is the core module which is used to find lowest priority servers.
Here for testing I have used same local server with different combinations so that testing of server can be done using different timeouts.


### Install Guide
Clone the Codebase from Github
Inside the project directory , run `npm install` to install dependencies
You can run mock server using `node server.js`, this will make servers available for testing 

### Running Module:
You can import directly import the modeule and run the module to use findServer function.

You can use Index.js using `node index.js` to see the working on module and importing style.


### Testing Module
`npm run test` will run the test for different test cases.
